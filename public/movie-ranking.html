<h2>My top 3 Horror Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mama</h3>
<p>Very light on blood and gore, but there are lot of powerfully scary, spooky images, as well as scenes.</p>

<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>Made in 2018. It is dark, creepy horror movie with ghosts,seances, death, burned bodies, screaming and panic. Very disturbing movie but greatly done at the same time.</p>

<h3>Annabelle</h3>
<p>Made in 2014 and while it is not as good as that film in 1968, Annabelle is still a good time at a movies and i recommend it.</p>
